## Description
{this is code for a triangle tracker application which will be used to differentiate between the different triangle types by determining the input values of the triangle's sides and classifying them as either Scalene, Equilateral or Isosceles. }
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* git clone url ""
* cd Triangle-Tracker-Project
* Open index.html in your browser.

## BDD
{Upon opening of the page, the user is prompted to input values of the three sides of a triangle. The application then determines if the triangle is Equilateral, Scalene or Isosceles.}
## Known Bugs
{ The application fails to alert the user if the sides inputed do not constitute a triangle but instead classifies it as a scalene triangle }
## Technologies Used
{ HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.}
